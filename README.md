# Interesting_code
In this code I have declared and initialised 3 variables i.e. a=10 , b=20 , c=30 and just attached a conditioanl operator with condition c>b>a which appeals to be mathematically correct ,but instead it is not executed  instead the control is handeled by the else condition. The main reason for this behaviour is that c>b>a is not equivalent to c>b &amp;&amp; b>a
